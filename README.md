Llama Assistant Readme
Introduction

The Llama Assistant is a Python script that demonstrates how to use the Llama model for building a conversational AI assistant. This assistant is capable of generating context-aware responses to user prompts. The script leverages the Hugging Face Hub to download the Llama model and the Llama-CPP library for efficient model inference.
Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

    Python 3.x
    pip (Python package manager)

Installation

To install the required Python packages, you can use pip:


pip install huggingface_hub
pip install llama-cpp-python==0.1.78

Usage

To use the Llama Assistant, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the Python script.

    Run the script using the following command  python llama_assistant.py



    The script will:
        Initialize the Llama Assistant with model parameters.
        Create a user prompt.
        Generate a response using the Llama model.
        Display the generated response on the console.

    You can customize the user prompt by modifying the prompt variable in the script.

Configuration

The script provides options for configuring the behavior of the Llama Assistant. You can adjust the following parameters in the code:

    model_name_or_path: Set the name or path of the Llama model you want to use.

    model_basename: Specify the base filename of the Llama model.

    n_threads: Control the number of CPU threads used for processing.

    n_batch: Set the batch size for model interactions.

    n_gpu_layers: Specify the number of GPU layers to use when interacting with the model.

    max_tokens: Limit the maximum number of tokens in the generated response.

    temperature: Adjust the randomness of the model's responses.

    top_p: Control the diversity of the response by limiting the generation to top cumulative probability tokens.

    repeat_penalty: Penalize repeated phrases or words in the response.

    top_k: Limit the number of tokens considered for text generation.

    echo: Print the generated response to the console.

Example

Here's an example of running the script with a user prompt:

python

prompt = "Write a linear regression in python with code"
response = llama_assistant.generate_response(prompt)
print("Assistant's Response:")
print(response)

Conclusion

The Llama Assistant demonstrates how to harness the power of the Llama model to build a conversational AI assistant. With the ability to generate context-aware responses, Llama paves the way for more engaging and meaningful interactions between humans and machines.
